As a primary basic course, Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course (on Coursera) is pretty famous. Already 3.9M people have done this. Link of the course: https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning. Now, we have used Octave for the assignments. Nowadays, we use Python more. So I am doing all assignments in Python also.
